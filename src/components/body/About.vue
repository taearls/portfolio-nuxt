			<br/>
			<p> 
				I love learning. As a web developer and software engineer, I am always attracted to a dynamic environment where I will continue to grow. Currently, I hold a full-time position as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ensighten.com" target="_blank">Ensighten</a>, a global company that provides client-side cybersecurity. Being on the Privacy team, I debug, optimize, and add new features that impact dozens of clients and thousands of end users.

            <br/>
			<p>
				In addition to my full-time job as a software engineer, I am always working on expanding my knowledge about object-oriented concepts and the latest frontend code. Outside of programming, I am an active musician and songwriter in Chicago, IL where I reside.
			</p>
            <br/>

				I have always gravitated towards work that applies my creativity, which is why I previously studied music, when I earned a bachelor's degree in Commercial Music from Millikin University. As a musician, the most valuable skill I've learned is the self-discipline to define goals, overcome failures, and keep moving forward to achieve them.
