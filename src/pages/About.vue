		<h1>About Tyler Earls</h1>
			<br/>
			<p> 
				As a software engineer, I am always attracted to a dynamic environment where I will continue to grow. Currently, I hold a full-time position as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ensighten.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Ensighten</a>, a global company that provides client-side cybersecurity. Being on the Privacy team, I debug, optimize, and add new features that impact dozens of clients and hundreds of thousands of end users.
