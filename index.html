			<!-- ABOUT ME -->	
		<section class="about">
 			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I love learning. As a worker, I am always attracted to a dynamic environment where I will continue to grow. At my previous job, after mastering the responsibilities of my position, I stopped growing, and it dawned on me that my ambition extends far beyond the static path I was on. <br/> <br/>

			Several months later, after studying and falling in love with coding in the depths of YouTube, I decided to formalize my education at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, where I was challenged to learn the best practices of fullstack developing, as well as generate a portfolio through my own projects. <br/> <br/>

			Even before diving into coding, I always gravitated towards work that applies my creativity, which is why I previously studied music, when I earned a bachelor's degree in Commercial Music from Millikin University. As a musician, the most valuable skill I've learned is the self-discipline to define goals, overcome failures, and keep moving forward towards achieving them. This discipline also applies to the ever-changing landscape of the internet and the dynamic code operating it.<br/> <br/>

			I pursued this career change because I love coding; it intersects problem solving and creativityâ€”both of which come naturally to me. I'm currently seeking full-time employment as a junior web developer in the Chicago area, and I would love to collaborate on projects with clients to help shape their ideas into reality.
