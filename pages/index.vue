      Hi there!
      <br>
      My name is Tyler Earls.
      <br>
      I am a software engineer and musician.

    <p class="text-soft-black dark:text-white mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-normal">
      Currently, I am looking for a full-time software engineering position. I have years of industry experience with TypeScript, React, Vue, Java, and more.

    <p class="text-soft-black dark:text-white mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-normal">
      Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I have been studying Rust, and now I use it regularly both on side projects and on Exercism's <a href="https://www.exercism.io" target="_blank">Rust track</a>. Ideally my next role will be at a company that's interested in adopting Rust.
    </p>
    <p class="text-soft-black dark:text-white my-4 text-lg md:text-xl leading-normal">
      Aside from this, I occasionally take on freelance frontend work. I love building clean and accessible
      UI applications that enrich the end user's experience with it.

      I'm also a very avid Star Trek fan. During these continuously unprecedented times, I find comfort in its optimistic view on the potential of humanity and its future.
