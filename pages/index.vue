      Hi there!
      I'm Tyler Earls.
      I am a software engineer and musician.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I work at <a
        href="https://www.ensighten.com"
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >Ensighten</a>, where I help provide client-side security and privacy law compliance for Fortune 500 companies. I enjoy the continuously evolving challenge of making the web safe for online users and their personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, I do freelance frontend work on the side. I love to build UI components that people interact with on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, I write songs as Cuckoo and the Birds. You can listen to my music <a
