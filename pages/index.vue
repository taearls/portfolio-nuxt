      Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
      <br>
      My name is Tyler Earls.
      <br>
      I am a software engineer and musician.

      Currently, I work at
      <a

        href="https://www.ensighten.com"
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >Ensighten</a>, where I help provide client-side security and privacy law compliance for our clients. I
      enjoy the continuously evolving challenge of making the web safe for online users and their
      personal data. I think it's meaningful work to provide privacy law compliance so that users have the fullest autonomy
      during their web experience that regulations allow.

      Aside from this work, I occasionally take on freelance frontend work. I love building clean and accessible
      UI components that enrich everyone's web experience.

      I'm also a very avid Star Trek fan. During these difficult times, I find comfort in its optimistic view on the potential of humanity and its future.
